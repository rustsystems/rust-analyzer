Semantic Normalizing Ontological Modeller

A 'normalized semantic model represented in ontological form'

   - Direct Symbolic Representations
      - ULO for abstract code-structure concepts
      - Lower-Direct for Rust Version specific
      - Lower-Direct for Codebase Lifetime concepts
      - Model-Constructs:
         - Syn, Sem, Sem-ULO, Behavioral-Abstract(lang model rule-sets), 
         - Behavioral-Direct (rt instance nuances?, applicable?), 
         - Runtime-Abs, Runtime-Actual? (availability or confidence of RT-ACT driven 
            by test coverage, picked up during automated test runtimes?)

            
   - Abstract/Advanced/Research-Targets:
      - Can RCC-8 be useful for structural analysis?
